I would like to express my gratitude first and foremost to my supervisor, Prof. Troels C. Petersen, for his guidance and patience throughout this project and for sharing his plentiful experience and passion for crafting creative and clever solutions to complicated problems. Many of the solutions explored in this report arose based on ideas of his. Working with him has been a great source of joy and inspiration. Secondly, I would like to thank Prof. Lars A. Buchhave for sharing his extensive background knowledge of all things spectrographs and calibration. I would also like to thank Lily L. Zhao for allowing me access to EXPRES data and answering occasional questions, as well as for her excellent work, which has given me something to aim for during this project. Finally, I would like to thank other students of Petersen's that have also taken part in the research, Liam J. Ward (MSc), Christian Michelsen (Ph.D), and Simon C. Debes (MSc), for the many great discussions and support.
