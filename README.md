## Jakob Harteg, bachelor project.

- Main functions for performing LFC calibration are in calib_functions.py. 
- Main functions for performing radial velocity computations are in radial_velocity_functions.py 
- Calibrtation is worked on in: calib_1.ipynb, calib_2.ipynb and calib_interpolation.ipynb (data is in dir calib_calib)
- Radial velocity is worked on in: in RV_computation_features.ipynb and RV_computation_orders.ipynb, (with a feature and order approach respectively), (data is not github dir)
