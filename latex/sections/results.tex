Figure \ref{fig:HD34411_rvs} shows my extracted relative radial velocity results for HD 34411 compared to those of Lily Zhao et al. (also available upon request \cite{yale_data}). As the Earth's movement has been removed, we are now on the scale of m/s instead of km/s. The method used by Lily Zhao et al. is a "chunk-by-chunk" method, where each spectrum is split into $\sim$2Ã… chunks for each of which an RV is found by shifting a template spectrum to match the observed spectrum. That is to say, a different method from mine. Our results however coincide within the same order of magnitude and with a similar rms of 1.67 m/s and 1.78 m/s, mine and theirs respectively. The residuals however do jump around quite a bit, and, of course, my mean error of 0.8 cm/s is not correct.

It is likely that the very small errors are due to the interpolation done when calculating the individual feature cross-correlations. The errors get smaller with increasing number of sampled data points, $N$, and looking again at figure \ref{fig:err_vs_run_time} in appendix \ref{appendix:RV_extraction}, it appears that the error falls off as something like $1/\sqrt{N}$. A quick correction that one could make would thus be to "scale back" the errors by multiplying with $\sqrt{1000}$. Doing this, my mean error for HD 34411 comes out to $0.0084 \text{ m/s} \times \sqrt{1000} = 0.27$ m/s, which is about 20 \% off from the results of Zhao et al.

I have analyzed data from three more stars and again compared the results with those of Zhao et al. As with HD 34411, my rms values come within a few m/s, but the residuals are big and my errors are too small. Rescaling is an improvement. Results are summarized in table \ref{tabel:results}, while plots can be found in appendix \ref{appendix:results}.
